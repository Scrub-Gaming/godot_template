# Godot Project Structure Template

This repository serves as a starting point for organizing Godot projects. It provides a clean and consistent folder structure to help maintain a well-organized project throughout development.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

The template includes the following folders:

- **`fonts/`**  
  Store all font files here, including `.ttf`, `.otf`, or bitmap fonts. Use this folder for both UI and in-game text assets.

- **`music/`**  
  Keep all background music and ambient tracks in this folder. Files can include `.ogg`, `.mp3`, or other supported audio formats.

- **`scenes/`**  
  Organize your game scenes here. Each major gameplay section (e.g., levels, menus, or interfaces) should have its own `.tscn` or `.scn` file.

- **`singletons/`**  
  Store global scripts or autoloaded nodes here. This folder is ideal for managing game state, settings, and utility functions.

- **`sounds/`**  
  Place all sound effects (SFX) in this folder, such as UI clicks, weapon sounds, or character noises.

- **`textures/`**  
  Store all image assets here, including sprites, tilesets, and UI elements. Use subfolders if necessary for further categorization.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd godot-template
   ```

2. **Open in Godot**  
   Open the project in Godot by selecting the project folder in the Godot project manager.

3. **Start Building**  
   Use the provided folder structure to organize your assets and scenes as you develop your game.

## ðŸ›  Tips for Organization

- Use descriptive file names for assets (e.g., `menu_background.png` instead of `bg.png`).
- Group related assets together (e.g., create subfolders like `textures/characters/` or `scenes/levels/` if the project grows large).
- Keep reusable scripts in the `singletons/` folder for easy reference across the project.
